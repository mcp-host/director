This release introduces a number of major improvements to director:

- oAuth support
- ability to filter / omit tools from a proxy
- ability to disable a server
- ability to add tool prefixes
- ability to add prompts to proxy servers
- use yaml instead of json for configuration file

currently this functionality is available in the CLI and configuration file, we'll update the UI next.
