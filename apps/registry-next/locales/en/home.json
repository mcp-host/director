Prior to USB-C, you needed loads of different cables for different devices. Similarly, prior to MCP, you needed to build custom integrations to each resource you wanted your AI application to use.\n\nYou can also think of them as APIs that are specially designed for LLMs."

        "title": "What is the MCP protocol, client, and server?",
        "description": "MCP consists of three main components to create bridge between your AI applications and the resources they need.\n\n- **MCP servers** provide access to data sources and tools through a well-defined interface.\n- **MCP clients** connect to MCP servers and request resources/actions on behalf of your AI application.\n- **MCP protocol** defines the standardized message format for communication between MCP servers and clients. This includes handling tool discovery, authentication, and response handling.\n\nLetâ€™s look at an example:\n\n1. You ask Claude Desktop (MCP Client) to summarize your meeting notes from Notion.\n2. Claude Desktop connects to Notion via it's MCP Server to discover the available tools and resources. The client then requests the resource it's looking for using the tools at it's disposal.\n3. Notion (MCP Server) responds with the content of the requested resource and Claude Desktop is able to create it's summary for the request."

        "title": "What are the capabilities of MCP?",
        "description": "Both MCP clients and servers offer different capabilities.\n\n**MCP servers** provide the fundamental blocks for adding context to your AI applications. The following capabilities allow for powerful interactions between clients, servers and LLMs:\n\n- **Prompts** are templates that can be used to generate text or other content.\n- **Tools** are pre-built functions that can be used to perform specific tasks.\n- **Resources** are data sources that can be used to provide context to your AI application.\n\n**MCP clients** provide access to MCP servers and request resources/actions on behalf of your AI application. They also expose the following capabilities:\n\n- **Roots** allow MCP servers to understand which directories and files they have access to in a filesystem.\n- **Sampling** allows MCP servers to request LLM completions or generations via MCP clients.\n - **Elicitation** allows an MCP server to request additional information from users through an MCP Client."
