# Prerequisites

- Works on latest **MacOS** and **Ubuntu Linux**.
- `node` & `npm` for the CLI.
- `uvx` for most of the servers. 
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/download), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed. (if you'd like director to configure them automatically).


# Quickstart

The fastest way to try director is to use the install script. This will download the dependencies, run the latest version of director and open up the studio in your browser:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://director.run/install.sh | sh
director quickstart
```

# Alternative Methods

## Installing Locally

If you'd like to install director locally, you can do so via `npm`.

```bash
npm install -g @director.run/cli
director serve # start the gateway
director studio # open the studio in your browser
```

## Getting started with the CLI

If you'd like to set up director without going through the UI, you can do so via the CLI. If you'd like to see a more detailed example, you can check out the [CLI Reference](../sdk/cli).

```bash
npm install -g @director.run/cli
director serve # start the gateway
director create my-first-proxy # create a proxy
director add fetch --target=my-first-proxy # add the fetch server to the proxy
director connect my-first-proxy --target=claude # connect the proxy to Claude
director connect my-first-proxy --target=cursor # connect the proxy to Cursor
director connect my-first-proxy # print the manual connection details
```
