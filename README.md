# Overview

Director is local-first MCP middleware that packages prompts, tools, and their configuration into reusable playbooks - accessible through a single endpoint.

Configure it your way: CLI, YAML, UI, or SDK. Share playbooks across agents and teams. Switch contexts for different tasks or environments. Audit every tool call. Sandbox untrusted servers. All running on your machine, not ours.

# Benefits

- üìö **Playbooks**: Package prompts, tools & configuration together into re-usable playbooks that you can execute from any MCP client.
- üöÄ **Portability**: Share MCP config across agents and between team members through a single YAML file.
- üéØ **Tool Filtering**: Increase accuracy by only adding relevant tools to your context.
- üîê **Security**: Easily run untrusted MCP servers in an isolated Docker container or VM.
- üìä **Observability**: Comprehensive JSON logging for all MCP method calls that you can drain to your existing logging infrastructure.
- üîß **Flexibility**: Layered architecture allows you to configure director via declarative config, Typescript SDK, API, CLI or UI. 
- üè† **Local-First**: Privacy focused design that doesn't require API keys, accounts or signups.
- üîå **MCP Native**: Compatible with all MCP clients and servers. We support all MCP transports as well as oAuth.
